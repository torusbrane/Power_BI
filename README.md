Over the next few weeks, we will be going through the example of an SQL Server, 
reading from that server, properly cleaning the data, using ETL to prepare it 
for data visualization, and using Power BI for the data visualization.

The end goal of this tutorial is to become more familiar with SQL, SQL queries,
Python, Jupyter Notebooks (using Python of course), and Power BI for data
visualization.

A supplemental addition to this course would be to use different data 
visualization tools, such as Streamlit or Matplotlib. This will be a side
project for supplemental learning.
